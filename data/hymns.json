Upon that cross of Jesus\nMine eyes at times can see\nThe very dying form of One\nWho suffer'd there for me;\nAnd from my striken heart, with tears,\nTwo wonders I confess:\nThe wonders of redeeming love,\nAnd my unworthiness.\n\n3. O safe and happy shelter!\nO refuge tried and sweet!\nO sacred place where Heaven's love\nAnd Heaven's justice meet!\nAs to the exil'd patriarch\nThat wondrous dream was given,\nSo seems my Savior's cross to me:\nA ladder up to Heav'n.\n\n4. I take, O cross, your shadow\nFor my abiding place;\nI ask no other sunshine than\nThe sunshine of his face;\nContent to let the world go by,\nTo know no gain or loss;\nMy sinful self my only shame,\nMy glory all the cross.\n\nSource:Hymns and Devotions for Daily Worship #126c",
