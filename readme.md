## Overview

PsalmPilot helps worship leaders to more effectively match hymns to scripture, liturgical season, and congregation preferences, so planners can choose songs that fit the sermon and service flow.

Over time, it surfaces trends and recommends diverse options that balances familiarity and freshness, improving congregational participation and cohesion. Leaders get reasoned, adjustable suggestions that support consistent, thoughtful worship planning across regular services and special events.

## Filters

Leaders are able to filter on any or all of the following features:

- Time of year
- Congregational music and hymnal preferences
- Role of the song in the service (prelude, closing, etc)
- Song popularity
