To all my weak complaints and cries\nYour mercy lent an ear,\nBefore my feeble tho'ts had learned\nTo form themselves in prayer.\nThru' hidden dangers, toils, and deaths\nIt gently cleared my way,\nAnd thru' the pleasing snares of vice\nMore to be feared than they.\n\n3. When worn with sickness, often you\nWith health renewed my face,\nAnd when in sins and sorrows sunk,\nRevived my soul with grace.\nYour bounteous hand with worldly bliss\nHas made my cup run o'er,\nAnd in a kind and faithful friend\nHas doubled all my store.\n\n4. Thru ev'ry period of my life\nYour goodness I'll pursue,\nAnd after death in distant worlds\nThe glorious theme renew.\nWhen nature fails, and day and night\nDivide your works no more,\nMy ever-grateful heart, O Lord,\nYour mercy shall adore.\n\nSource:Hymns and Devotions for Daily Worship #319",
